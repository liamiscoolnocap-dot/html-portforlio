<h2>(Not to be confused with my top 3)</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Hercules</h3>
<p>For some reason, I watched this over 15 times when I was younger.</p>
<h3>The Lego Movie</h3>
<p>It was all stop motion, which is a fact that really suprised me</p>
<h3>One Piece Red</h3>
<p>Don't know why, just naturally think of it</p>
